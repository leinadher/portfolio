I’m a Data Scientist with a solid foundation in architecture, holding an MSc in Architecture and currently pursuing an MSc in Information and Data Science.

For the past 5 years, I’ve integrated technical expertise with creative design in developing detailed architectural plans and overseeing construction processes, developing a keen eye for detail and a strong grasp of technical complexities. Now, I’m excited to transition those skills into the realm of data science, where I aim to build data-driven insights and innovative solutions through machine learning and analytics.

With a passion for creating visually compelling designs and a deep appreciation for nature sports and architectural heritage, I’m eager to apply my unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to the dynamic world of data science and business analytics.
